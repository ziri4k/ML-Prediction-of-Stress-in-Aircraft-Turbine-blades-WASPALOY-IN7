Blades are important in the journey of flight. Various types of aircraft engines use blades, from turbofans to turbojets, sturdy blades are required for the running of an aircraft engine, producing thrust to enable flight.

Turbine blades are put through very strenuous environments inside a gas turbine. They face high temperatures, high stresses, and a potential environment of high vibration. All three of these factors can lead to blade failures, potentially destroying the engine, therefore turbine blades are carefully designed to resist these conditions.


Turbine blades are under stress from centrifugal force and fluid forces, which can lead to fractures, yielding, or creep failures. The first stage of a modern gas turbine is subjected to temperatures around 2,500 °F (1,370 °C), which can weaken the blades and make them more susceptible to creep and corrosion failures. In gas turbines, vibrations from the engine and turbine can lead to fatigue damage at high temperatures, such as around 1,500°F (820°C). Military jet engines, like the Snecma M88, can reach turbine temperatures as high as 2,900°F (1,590°C). (Adildev, 2015)


Artificial Neural networks mimic the human brain and can be used to predict with layers formed by neurons. Artificial Neural Networks can be expressed mathematically as linear algebra where weights and biases are matrices and vectors, which will be shown in the theory section of this paper.
